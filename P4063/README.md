**Session Description:**

Cortana skills can make authenticated calls to services using OAuth 2.0 authentication. The Cortana skills developer portal makes it easy for you to link a connected service to your skill and Cortana provides an easy way for end-users to manage credentials. In this session, we walk through how to configure a connected service and how to access the authentication tokens within your bot to make authenticated calls.
